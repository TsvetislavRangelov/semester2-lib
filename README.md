# S2 Individual Project

This is a university project I did in my 2nd Semester. It is a simple **ASP.NET Razor Pages** application for managing a library of manga comics. 
Also supports logging in/registering with basic hashing and salting via MD5 and profile picture uploads. Rest of the functionality is plain CRUD.
