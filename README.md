# S2 Individual Project

This is a university project I did in my 2nd Semester(2022). It is a simple **ASP.NET Razor Pages** application for managing a library of manga comics. 
Also supports logging in/registering with basic hashing and salting via MD5 and profile picture uploads. Rest of the functionality is plain CRUD.

Albeit MD5 is not secure, the point of this project was to get familiar with the layering and SOLID principles in an actual application.
